## Installation

    $ bundle add 2n-patterns

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install 2n-patterns

## Usage

Simply install the gem, and then inherit from the classes provided by the gem. Use tests as direction if you are unsure.

## Development

`bundle` for installing stuff. If you want to run all automated tests at once, do `bench test/automated/` or run specific tests regular `ruby path/to/file`

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb` and gemspec, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
